# Challenge #

As proposed, here is a small challenge for you:-) The idea is to create a simple music player. It is expected the music player has a limited set of music files (`music` folder) and offers play/pause/next/previous track functionality. It should also offer to seek through the current playing track using a slider. The size of the UI is defined based on the background image.

You should create a git repository on github (https://github.com/) or bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/), where all necessary graphics and fonts (you should use the font provided OpenSans-Regular), as also music files and covers will be uploaded.

If you miss anything, please let me know. We can communicate via the issue tracking, mail, hipchat or Skype.


What do we expect:

* clean, thoughtful code
* clean, frequent commits
* You use QtCreator from Qt5
* comments which explains the code from your perspective
* beautiful user interface (does not have to be exact)
* components (e.g. Tool to click an icon and Slider to seek the music)
* some animations (e.g. when an icon is pressed it should get a little bit smaller)
* a suggestion for an extension (what else could the music player do, and how)
* only QML/JS code, No C++ code
* The slider might be the most difficult part, so ensure itâ€™s well structured.

Please propose a time, when do you think you can have it finished. I expect you need to do some studies first, before you can start with the actual coding.

Thinks you should look at:

* git :-) (http://git-scm.com/documentation)
* Qt5 (http://qt-project.org/downloads)
* ListModel/Item/Rectangle/Image/BorderImage/Behavior/NumberAnimation/Audio/FontLoader from Qt Quick (aka QML), see Qt Documentation

To play audio you can use the QtMultimedia module (http://qmlbook.org/ch10/index.html#playing-media, http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qml-qtmultimedia-audio.html)

I took the example from http://www.sketchappsources.com/free-source/244-music-player-widget.html, just for your background information.

Have fun and enjoy! Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
